            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that plays a vital role in modern web development. Alongside HTML (for structure) and CSS (for styling), JavaScript enables web pages to be interactive and dynamic. It was initially created to enhance web pages by providing interactive features.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript was created by <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> in 1995 at Netscape Communications. Originally called "Mocha," the language was later renamed to "LiveScript" and finally to "JavaScript" as part of a marketing strategy to capitalize on the growing popularity of Java. It became standardized by ECMA International as "ECMAScript." The first official version was ECMAScript 1, which was released in 1997.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is crucial for modern web development for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Client-Side Execution:</strong> JavaScript runs directly in the browser, enabling fast and interactive pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> JavaScript is compatible with all modern browsers and works across different devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Rich Ecosystem:</strong> JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js.</li>
                <li><strong>Server-Side Development:</strong> With Node.js, JavaScript can be used for backend development as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Asynchronous Programming:</strong> JavaScript handles asynchronous operations like data fetching or real-time updates smoothly without blocking the user interface.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is used to enhance the interactivity and functionality of web pages. Some of its capabilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> Modify HTML elements and structure in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Form Validation:</strong> Validate user inputs on forms before submission.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> Implement dynamic content like sliders, dropdowns, and pop-ups.</li>
                <li><strong>Web APIs:</strong> Interact with external resources like APIs to fetch data.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Real-World Use Cases of JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is used in a wide variety of applications across the web, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single-Page Applications (SPAs):</strong> Websites that load dynamically and provide an app-like experience, e.g., Facebook, Gmail.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Games:</strong> JavaScript powers browser-based games like 2048 and Flappy Bird.</li>
                <li><strong>E-commerce Websites:</strong> Sites like Amazon or eBay use JavaScript for product displays and interactive shopping experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Communication:</strong> Applications like Slack use JavaScript for live updates and instant messaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> JavaScript libraries like D3.js are used to create interactive data charts.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Code Names & Versions of JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript has evolved over time, and its versions have been standardized by ECMA International under the name <strong>ECMAScript</strong>. Below are some notable code names and versions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mocha:</strong> The original code name before JavaScript became LiveScript.</li>
                <li><strong>LiveScript:</strong> The language's name before it was rebranded as JavaScript.</li>
                <li><strong>ECMAScript:</strong> The official standard of JavaScript. Significant versions include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ES3 (1999):</strong> Introduced regular expressions and exception handling.</li>
                    <li><strong>ES5 (2009):</strong> Brought features like strict mode, JSON support, and better property control.</li>
                    <li><strong>ES6/ES2015 (2015):</strong> Introduced arrow functions, promises, classes, and modules.</li>
                    <li><strong>ES2020 and beyond:</strong> Continuous updates with features like optional chaining and nullish coalescing.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
